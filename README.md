## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling

### What I learned


To add TailwindCSS to Vite project the following [guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vue-3-vite):
In main.js:
```js
import './style.css';
import "tailwindcss/tailwind.css";
```
```html
  <body class="bg-myLightGray flex justify-center items-center">
    <script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
  </body>
```
To extend TailwindCSS defaults with additional fonts and customized colors:
```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        "karla": ["karla"], //url of Google fonts added to <head> in index.html
      },
      colors: {
        "myCyan": "hsl(179, 62%, 43%)",
        "myBrightYellow": "hsl(71, 73%, 54%)",
        "myLightGray": "hsl(204, 43%, 93%)",
        "myGrayishBlue": "hsl(218, 22%, 67%)",
        "myGreenLight": "hsla(179,47%, 52%, 1)",
        "myGreenDark": "hsla(179,61%, 44%, 1)",
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Continued development

In this project I have applied more concepts of TailwindCSS. However this makes easy because of previous background in CSS basics.
